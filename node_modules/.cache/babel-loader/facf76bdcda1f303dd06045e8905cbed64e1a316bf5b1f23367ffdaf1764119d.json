Through an e-commerce website, a business can process orders, accept payments, manage shipping and logistics, and provide customer service. Get your business online Use Mailchimp's all-in-one platform tools to give your brand a home and start selling your products and services. Sign up An e-commerce website is one that allows people to buy and sell physical goods, services, and digital products over the internet rather than at a brick-and-mortar location. Through an e-commerce website, a business can process orders, accept payments, manage shipping and logistics, and provide customer service. It\\u2019s tough to imagine daily life without e-commerce. We order food, clothes, and furniture; we register for classes and other online services; we download books, music, and movies; and so much more. E-commerce has taken root and is here to stay. The term \\u201Ce-commerce\\u201D simply means the sale of goods or services on the internet. In its most basic form, e-commerce involves electronically transferring funds and data between 2 or more parties. This form of business has evolved quite a bit since its beginnings in the electronic data interchange of the 1960s and the inception of online shopping in the 1990s. In recent years, e-commerce has enjoyed a massive boost from the rise of smartphones, which allow consumers to shop from nearly anywhere. MailChimp Content Refresh -115 graphic -1-01 What is an e-commerce website? Much like a traditional physical retail store, e-commerce websites allow consumers and businesses to buy and sell to one another on a designated platform. The main difference between e-commerce and physical commerce, however, is that e-commerce transactions occur entirely over the internet rather than at a brick-and-mortar location. Types of e-commerce sites The scope of e-commerce is vast, but the types of sites that host electronic transactions can be broken down according to the parties involved. Business-to-consumer (B2C): Probably the most familiar to the average person, a B2C site enables an exchange of goods or services between a business and a consumer, such as buying a T-shirt from your favorite online shop. Business-to-business (B2B): A B2B platform facilitates electronic transactions between two businesses. If you own a company that sells T-shirts, for example, you might buy those shirts from an online wholesaler. Business-to-administration (B2A): A B2A site facilitates electronic exchanges between an organization and a public institution, like the website of a company that designed your city\\u2019s web portal, for instance. Consumer-to-consumer (C2C): A C2C site, often known as a marketplace, hosts an exchange of goods between 2 or more consumers. Examples include websites like Etsy and eBay. Consumer-to-business (C2B): On a C2B site, individuals offer goods or services to businesses. This could be a freelance SEO expert who works with companies in a certain industry or an influencer paid to promote a company\\u2019s products. Consumer-to-administration (C2A): Similar to B2A, this type of site allows a consumer to provide information, goods, or services to public administration and governmental organizations\\u2014think paying a parking ticket on your city\\u2019s web portal. Types of products sold via e-commerce The digital component of e-commerce allows sellers to offer a wide range of products, some of which wouldn\\u2019t be possible to sell in a physical location. Physical goods Items such as clothing, furniture, food, or supplies are tangible products that can be stored in a warehouse. Sellers display goods on their e-commerce website, where consumers can like, save, or purchase them. Upon purchase, the business ships the item to the customer. Services E-commerce sites are also a popular way to sell services, like consultations, maintenance, tutoring, lessons, and more. Whether you want to learn to code a website or you\\u2019re looking for an experienced trainer to help fix your dog\\u2019s troublesome barking habit, there\\u2019s no shortage of assistance available online. Digital products Digital products\\u2014like online courses, software, podcasts, music, and e-books\\u2014are becoming increasingly popular on e-commerce sites as well. The rise of digital products has opened up a new way to learn skills on demand. What should your e-commerce site do? MailChimp Content Refresh -115 graphic -2-01 When it comes to selling goods and services online, there are a few basic functions every e-commerce site should include. Accept orders If you\\u2019re running a business that sells a product, your e-commerce site must be able to accept orders from your customers. This process can be more complex than you might expect. For each order, your site will need to: Record customer information (name, address, etc.) Collect customers\\u2019 acceptance of your terms of service Calculate any applicable taxes Apply coupons or discounts Generate order and tracking numbers Share delivery details Process billing information Provide access to a payment gateway Take payments There should be a seamless transition from your website to a payment gateway. Typically, payment gateways allow customers to: Select a payment option Provide details such as credit card numbers and CVVs Use multi-step authentication for secure payments Handle shipping and logistics Once your site has handled the order and payment process for a customer, the next step is delivery. As a seller, your goal is to ensure that customers receive the right product on time and in perfect condition. To help this process along, you can either handle shipping and logistics yourself or use a third-party provider. No matter which method you choose, your website should be able to initiate the process accurately and consistently. Your site will also need to have a process in place for accepting returned items. Also known as reverse logistics, this process is just as important as shipping outbound goods. Provide customer service Inevitably, your customers will need to communicate with you about their order or experience. They may need to correct their personal information, make an exchange, or return a faulty product. Your website is where these customers will turn to get in touch with you. The easier you make it for customers to connect\\u2014with a contact form or chat service, for example\\u2014the easier it will be to solve their problems quickly. What metrics should you track? Tracking e-commerce metrics can help you measure success, showing you what\\u2019s working for your customers and what might need some improvement. Most e-commerce platforms have some built-in data tracking, but for truly robust metrics, you\\u2019ll want to connect your website to an analytics platform, such as Google Analytics. Website traffic Your website traffic is a straightforward measurement of visitors to your site and the number of people who buy something while they\\u2019re there. Traffic often paints a clear picture of the effectiveness of your latest e-commerce marketing efforts. Bounce rate Your bounce rate is the percentage of visitors who leave your site after viewing only one page or interacting with just one area of your site. If you see a high bounce rate, consumers probably aren\\u2019t making many purchases, so it\\u2019s important to figure out why they\\u2019re leaving. The problem may come down to marketing, pricing, the layout of your site, or a host of other factors. Visitor conversion rate The visitor conversion rate captures the percentage of website visitors who become paying customers. Conversion rates are important because they show how effectively you\\u2019re able to persuade folks to make a purchase. When you have a low conversion rate, customers are letting you know that something is missing from your business or your marketing. Cart abandonment rate Just like in a physical store, an abandoned cart in e-commerce is one that has been filled and deserted by the shopper. While abandoned carts can be frustrating as a seller, they\\u2019re not always a bad sign. Many shoppers use their carts as a wishlist or placeholder as they look around for the right product. Regardless, you want customers to re-engage and buy those items in their cart. You can encourage them to complete their purchase by offering a discount or nudging them with a promotional email. Email subscriber engagement It\\u2019s easy to track how many people are reading your emails\\u2014and how many are becoming customers. Monitoring your email subscriber engagement can help you determine which aspects of your email marketing are effective and what might still need some work. Mobile users Mobile e-commerce has become so prevalent that it\\u2019s even earned its own name\\u2014m-commerce. This makes it even more critical for you to track the number of mobile visitors to your site. It\\u2019s also helpful to pay attention to how many of your mobile visitors eventually become customers. Time spent Looking at the time customers spend on your site can give you valuable insight into their behavior. Are your visitors browsing but not buying? Maybe your website is appealing, but your price point is too high. Are visitors bouncing almost immediately? Maybe your site is difficult to navigate. Pages per visit Another metric that can help unpack customer behavior is pages-per-visit. This measures how many individual pages on your site customers are visiting and can help you measure the effectiveness of your online store. Building your e-commerce business Starting an e-commerce business takes research, planning, and passion. With the right tools, you can tap into the market of online shoppers seeking products from the comfort of their own homes. MailChimp Content Refresh -115 graphic -3-01 Here are steps to follow when you\\u2019re ready to move your venture forward. Step #1: Choose your product Before you get started, make sure you have a clear idea of your niche. Even better, it helps to consider what you want to contribute to the market and begin with a vision of the items you hope to sell. Once you\\u2019ve landed on a specific product or service, take your time and do some research. Start by looking into other businesses in your industry. Pay attention to what they\\u2019re doing well and what you think you could improve on. Carefully examine their business model, marketing techniques, and the functionality of their website. These observations can help shape your own plan. Make sure you also consider the potential for market saturation, the ease (or difficulty) of entry into the market, and what unique needs your product may be able to fill. Step #2: Find your target audience Once you know what you want to sell, it\\u2019s time to identify your target customer. Consider who your ideal buyer is and what qualities they have. It can be helpful to develop a customer persona during this part of the process. A customer or buyer persona is a fictionalized version of your ideal customer. This persona can help you predict customer behavior and understand your future clients more deeply. Factors you might want to consider when developing a persona are age, location, income level, and personal goals or values. Whether you build detailed personas or not, keeping these qualities in mind can help you predict your real customers\\u2019 online presence and marketing preferences. Step #3: Validate your product Even with a vision of your product and a clear picture of your target audience, you still have some significant hurdles to clear before you can launch your brand. First, you need to determine whether your idea will be viable in the actual marketplace. You\\u2019ll want to consider both market-based criteria like market size, competitors, and industry trends and product-based criteria like price point, markups, sales tactics, and regulations. When validating your product, you should come away with a firm understanding of the costs you\\u2019ll face as a business owner. For e-commerce sellers, you often have more flexibility in your pricing since you won\\u2019t have the cost of a storefront or, in the case of digital products, warehouse and manufacturing expenses. Step #4: Shape your business If your business is centered around a physical product, you\\u2019ll need to establish a model for obtaining, packaging, and shipping your orders. Some of your options include: Making the product yourself and handling the cost of shipping Having your product manufactured by another company Reselling wholesale items at a markup Dropshipping items by working with a third-party inventory handler Offering a digital product that eliminates the need for production or shipping Once you\\u2019ve determined how you\\u2019ll move your product, it\\u2019s time to write a business plan. This plan will be essential to refining your goals and guiding your next steps. Think about the type of business you\\u2019re starting, your product, your ideal customer, your source of income, your staffing needs, and your operations model. An effective business plan is often between 15 and 20 pages and includes: An executive summary Your company overview Market analysis Definitions of your product or services An actionable marketing plan A plan for logistics A well-developed financial plan Step #5: Pick a name If you don\\u2019t already have one in mind, your e-commerce store will need a memorable name. A great business name is compelling, descriptive, and one of a kind. Check to make sure your business name is available on your secretary of state\\u2019s website and the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office website. After you\\u2019ve made a decision, you\\u2019ll want to: Claim your domain name. Consult with an attorney to legally register your business as an LLC, corporation, partnership, or proprietorship. Apply for your employer identification number (EIN) through the IRS. Apply for any necessary business permits or licenses, including sales tax permits, health and safety permits, and more. Step #6: Build your website After you\\u2019ve created your new business, it\\u2019s finally time to build your e-commerce website. Your goal should be to create a polished website that reflects your new brand\\u2019s values and aesthetics. The basic steps of website-building include: Purchasing a domain. If you haven\\u2019t already, you can buy a custom domain with Mailchimp. This makes it easier for customers to find you and lends credibility to your new site. Choosing a website builder. Mailchimp makes it easy to design and build the website you\\u2019re envisioning for your brand. The all-in-one platform simplifies the process of creating and promoting your website. Mapping out your site. Once you\\u2019ve taken the time to explore the website builder and its capabilities, it\\u2019s helpful to create a site map. Focus on making your site easy to navigate and fun to explore. Designing your aesthetic. Take your time establishing a visual package that represents your brand\\u2019s values and culture. Mailchimp\\u2019s flexible tools make it simple to elevate your website design with professional formats and appealing branding. Building out your pages. Each page on your website should meet the needs of your target audience. Remember that all roads should lead to creating new customers. Connecting your payment processor. Make sure your website can accept payments before you launch. Optimizing your SEO. Search engine optimization (SEO) is the key to gaining visibility online. Make sure you\\u2019re using keywords wisely so you can connect with as many customers as possible. Launching your e-commerce store. Double-check your e-commerce launch checklist before going live with your new online store. Step #7: Develop a marketing strategy Marketing is essential to your store, both before and after you launch, so you\\u2019ll want to make sure you develop a compelling marketing strategy to get the word out. Branch out When it comes to marketing, it\\u2019s often beneficial to use multiple channels to reach your customers. For example, you could: Promote your blog on your social media channels\\u2014and vice versa. Post on multiple social media channels and see which platform garners the most engagement from your audience. Partner with influencers or affiliate marketers and provide them with links to shoppable landing pages they can share. Tweak your SEO strategies Search engine optimization is an ongoing process. To maintain visibility, focus on developing your site\\u2019s SEO with effective copy, product descriptions, and up-to-date blog posts. Keep in mind that your entire site should align with current SEO standards to maximize your exposure. Invest in CRM Customer relationship management, or CRM, is a game-changer for online businesses. A CRM platform can support or handle your e-commerce marketing ventures by gathering important data about demographics and behaviors. In other words, investing in CRM can help you optimize your marketing choices and boost sales. Make the most of email Email plays a significant role in any marketing efforts because it allows you to connect with people who\\u2019ve already shown interest in your product. Email marketing campaigns are a great way to share exclusive offers, promotions, company updates, and product launch details. You could even add surveys to your email to collect customer feedback and help shape the future of your brand. Get ready to launch your e-commerce website The journey to launching your online store isn\\u2019t always easy, but the key is to keep your goals in mind and take the process one step at a time. And with Mailchimp\\u2019s comprehensive tools at your fingertips, you\\u2019ll have everything you need to build\\u2014and grow\\u2014your new business. Frequently asked questions How do e-commerce websites work? E-commerce sites are similar to other types of websites in that they provide visitors with information. However, e-commerce websites allow users to make purchases online using payment processors and payment gateways. E-commerce websites list products, features, pricing, and CTAs that help users navigate the sales process. These websites connect to a product database containing information about the products available, including content and images. Many e-commerce websites, including B2B and B2C, facilitate transactions from consumers to businesses. Ultimately, e-commerce websites allow customers to purchase products and services online. How do I create a free e-commerce website? You can create a free e-commerce website using Mailchimp\\u2019s website builder. The website builder helps you easily design, customize, and promote free websites for e-commerce businesses. The best part is that you don\\u2019t need design or development experience to create a stunning website to showcase products, attract buyers, and finalize transactions. Instead, you can use various web design tips and landing page templates to build a mobile-optimized website quickly and start selling products immediately. With Mailchimp, you\\u2019ll also get access to several marketing tools. Through our platform, you can purchase a domain for your e-commerce site, create landing pages, set up an online store, build out your social media pages, and more. In addition, with built-in forms, behavioral targeting, and analytics, you can begin tracking the performance of your website and digital marketing strategies as customers move through their journeys. How can I start an e-commerce business? Starting an e-commerce business may be more cost-effective than starting another type of company. However, it requires research and proper planning. First, you must choose your product or service. Once you know what products or services you want to sell, you must identify your target audience. Your target audience consists of the customers who are looking for your product as a solution to their problems. Next, you\\u2019ll need a business plan that explains how you\\u2019ll make your business succeed through product sourcing, marketing, pricing, and goal setting. From there, you can make a website, source products, and start selling your products online.\"\n      }, void 0, false, {\n        fileName: _jsxFileName,\n        lineNumber: 12,\n        columnNumber: 13\n      }, this)\n    }, void 0, false, {\n      fileName: _jsxFileName,\n      lineNumber: 11,\n      columnNumber: 9\n    }, this)]\n  }, void 0, true, {\n    fileName: _jsxFileName,\n    lineNumber: 6,\n    columnNumber: 5\n  }, this);\n};\n_c = DescriptionBox;\nexport default DescriptionBox;\nvar _c;\n$RefreshReg$(_c, \"DescriptionBox\");","map":{"version":3,"names":["React","jsxDEV","_jsxDEV","DescriptionBox","className","children","fileName","_jsxFileName","lineNumber","columnNumber","_c","$RefreshReg$"],"sources":["/Users/eunjin/Desktop/E-commerce/frontend/src/Components/DescriptionBox/DescriptionBox.jsx"],"sourcesContent":["import React from 'react'\nimport './DescriptionBox.css'\n\nconst DescriptionBox = () => {\n  return (\n    <div className='descriptionbox'>\n        <div className=\"descriptionbox-navigator\">\n            <div className=\"descriptionbox-nav-box\">Description</div>\n            <div className=\"descriptionbox-nav-box fade\">Reviews (122)</div>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"descriptionbox-description\">\n            <p>\n\nA website that allows people to buy and sell physical goods, services, and digital products over the internet rather than at a brick-and-mortar location.

You’ll want to consider both market-based criteria like market size, competitors, and industry trends and product-based criteria like price point, markups, sales tactics, and regulations.\n\nWhen validating your product, you should come away with a firm understanding of the costs you’ll face as a business owner. For e-commerce sellers, you often have more flexibility in your pricing since you won’t have the cost of a storefront or, in the case of digital products, warehouse and manufacturing expenses.\n\nStep #4: Shape your business\nIf your business is centered around a physical product, you’ll need to establish a model for obtaining, packaging, and shipping your orders. Some of your options include:\n\nMaking the product yourself and handling the cost of shipping\nHaving your product manufactured by another company\nReselling wholesale items at a markup\nDropshipping items by working with a third-party inventory handler\nOffering a digital product that eliminates the need for production or shipping\nOnce you’ve determined how you’ll move your product, it’s time to write a business plan. This plan will be essential to refining your goals and guiding your next steps. Think about the type of business you’re starting, your product, your ideal customer, your source of income, your staffing needs, and your operations model.\n\nAn effective business plan is often between 15 and 20 pages and includes:\n\nAn executive summary\nYour company overview\nMarket analysis\nDefinitions of your product or services\nAn actionable marketing plan\nA plan for logistics\nA well-developed financial plan\nStep #5: Pick a name\nIf you don’t already have one in mind, your e-commerce store will need a memorable name. A great business name is compelling, descriptive, and one of a kind. Check to make sure your business name is available on your secretary of state’s website and the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office website. After you’ve made a decision, you’ll want to:\n\nClaim your domain name.\nConsult with an attorney to legally register your business as an LLC, corporation, partnership, or proprietorship.\nApply for your employer identification number (EIN) through the IRS.\nApply for any necessary business permits or licenses, including sales tax permits, health and safety permits, and more.\nStep #6: Build your website\nAfter you’ve created your new business, it’s finally time to build your e-commerce website.

For example, you could:\n\nPromote your blog on your social media channels—and vice versa.\nPost on multiple social media channels and see which platform garners the most engagement from your audience.\nPartner with influencers or affiliate marketers and provide them with links to shoppable landing pages they can share.\nTweak your SEO strategies\nSearch engine optimization is an ongoing process.

Keep in mind that your entire site should align with current SEO standards to maximize your exposure.\n\nInvest in CRM\nCustomer relationship management, or CRM, is a game-changer for online businesses. A CRM platform can support or handle your e-commerce marketing ventures by gathering important data about demographics and behaviors. In other words, investing in CRM can help you optimize your marketing choices and boost sales.\n\nMake the most of email\nEmail plays a significant role in any marketing efforts because it allows you to connect with people who’ve already shown interest in your product.
